# Algebraic data types

Haskell allows programmers to create their own data types through algebraic data
types.  *ADT* definitions start with the *data* keyword.  It is followed by a *type
constructor*, an equal sign and *data constructors*.

``` haskell
data <type constructor> = <data constructors>
```

*ADT*s are constructed from *Sum* and *Product* types.

## Sum types

*Sum* types can be used to express *enumeration types*.  In the following
example we introduce a type named *Colour*.  It is possible to instantiate
values of the *Colour* type with one of the *data constructors*, namely: *Red*,
*Green*, *Blue*, *Yellow* or *Brown*.

Create a file called *Colour.hs* with the content:
``` haskell
module Colour where

data Colour = Red
            | Green
            | Blue
            | Yellow
            | Brown
            deriving (Show, Eq)

aColour :: Colour
aColour = Blue

someColours :: [Colour]
someColours = [Red, Green, Brown]
```

The *deriving* keyword is used to add functionality automatically to a type.
In this case printing *Colour* will be easier and values of Colour can be
compared with the equality operator.  Do not let the *deriving (Show, Eq)* line
distract you from the exercises.  We will talk about them in detail later.

If you want to try out these functions and types in an executable, just create
*Main.hs* in the same folder with the following content.

``` haskell
module Main where

import Colour

main :: IO ()
main = print someColours
```

### Exercise
 * Data constructors are simple functions.  Load the *Colour.hs* file to ghci and
   ask for the type of the constructors.
 * Add an *ADT* called *Knight* to *Colour.hs* with possible values: *Arthur*,
   *Galahad*, *Robin*, *Lancelot*, *Bedevere*.  Add *deriving (Show, Eq)* to
   the end of the data type just like we did it with *Colour*.
 * Define the *favouriteColour :: Knight -> Colour* function and try it out in
   *ghci*.

# Pattern matching

Pattern matching *Sum* types allows us to handle values constructed with a
different data constructor differently.  Functions can have separate
implementations for each possible combination of data constructors of its
parameters.

``` haskell
pretty :: Bool -> String
pretty value = if value
               then "A true value."
               else "A false value."

prettyWithPattern :: Bool -> String
prettyWithPattern True = "A true value."
prettyWithPattern False = "A false value."

andWithPatterns :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
andWithPatterns True True = True
andWithPatterns False True = False
andWithPatterns True False = False
andWithPatterns False False = False
```

The first matching pattern is going to be used from top to bottom.  An exception
is going to be thrown if none of the patterns match the arguments.  A wildcard
pattern can be used to match any possible value of the given type.

``` haskell
andWithPatterns :: Bool -> Bool
andWithPatterns True True = True
andWithPatterns _ _ = False
```

### Exercise
 * Rewrite *favouriteColour :: Knight -> Colour* using pattern matching.
 * Remove a pattern from *favouriteColour* and call it with a value matching the
   missing pattern.
 * Add a wildcard pattern as the last pattern of the function and call it again
   with a value matching the missing pattern.
