# Higher order functions

I have already mentioned that functions can be passed as an argument to a
function or returned from a function.  A function that returns a function or
accepts a function as parameter is called a *higher order function*.

## Map

Map is one of the most used higher order functions.  Let's have a look at it's
type and try to find out what it does.

``` haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

The first parameter is a function that maps from type *a* to type *b*.  The
second parameter is a list that contains values of type *a*.  The return value
is a list that contains values of type *b*.

There is only one way to create values of type *b*.  We need to use the function
passed as the first argument to *map*.  That function can create values of type
*b* using values of type *a* as its parameter.  There is only one source of
values of type *a*, the second parameter of map.  With a bit more imagination we
conclude that *map* calls the function to all values in the first list and
returns a list constructed from the result values.

Start ghci and try out the following lines:

``` haskell
:t map
:t show
:t map show

map show [1..10]
map (*2) [1..10]
```

### Exercise
 * Create the list *knights :: [Knight]* and map the *favouriteColour* function
   over the list. (Hint: Use the types defined in lecture 7.)
 * Implement the following function:

``` haskell
mymap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

 * Try out *mymap* on the map examples from the lecture.

## Map on other things

You can think of *map* as a function that calls its first parameter on the
content's of another value not specifically a list.  You might think about these
things as containers to build up an initial intuition.  This notion will change
as you see more examples that can not fit in this abstraction.

The idea of types that can be mapped over is expressed in the *Functor*
typeclass.  List is a *functor* and there are many other types implementing this
interface.  Every implementation specifies the *fmap* function.

``` haskell
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

This is the same type as *map* if you replace *[]* with *f*.
Let's have a look at other functors.

``` haskell
fmap (*2) [1..10]
fmap (*2) (Just 10)
fmap (*2) (Nothing)
fmap (*2) (Left 10)
fmap (*2) (Right 10)
```

We will not go deeper in the introductory course.  This should be enough to
start experimenting with functors.
