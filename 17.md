# Higher order functions

I have already mentioned that functions can be passed as an argument to a
function or returned from a function.  A function that returns a function or
accepts a function as parameter is called a *higher order function*.

## Map

Map is one of the most used higher order functions.  Let's have a look at it's
type and try to find out what it does.

``` haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

The first parameter is a function that maps from type *a* to type *b*.  The
second parameter is a list that contains values of type *a*.  The return value
is a list that contains values of type *b*.

There is only one way to create values of type *b*.  We need to use the function
passed as the first argument to *map*.  That function can create values of type
*b* using values of type *a* as its parameter.  There is only one source of
values of type *a*, the second parameter of map.  With a bit more imagination we
conclude that *map* calls the function to all values in the first list and
returns a list constructed from the result values.

Start ghci and try out the following lines:

``` haskell
:t map
:t show
:t map show

map show [1..10]
map (*2) [1..10]
```

### Exercise
 * Create the list *knights :: [Knight]* and map the *favouriteColour* function
   over the list. (Hint: Use the types defined in lecture 7.)
 * Complete the following function:

``` haskell
mymap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
mymap f [] = []
mymap f (x:xs) = (???) : (mymap f xs)
```
