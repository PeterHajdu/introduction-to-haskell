# Maybe

*Maybe* represents optional values.  It has two data constructors, *Just* and
*Nothing*.

``` haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

*Just <value>* is used for an existing value and *Nothing* if it does not exist.
The value can be extracted with pattern matching.

``` haskell
aFunction :: Maybe Int -> String
aFunction (Just val) = show val
aFunction Nothing = "Does not exist."

bFunction :: [Int] -> String
bFunction nums = case (calculation nums) of
                  Just result -> show result
                  Nothing -> "Does not exist."
```

Let's have a look at the mean function.

``` haskell
intMean :: Integral a => [a] -> a
intMean nums = let sumOfNums = sum nums
                   len = fromIntegral (length nums)
               in sumOfNums `div` len
```

Everything looks great so far but what happens if you call this function with
an empty list?

``` haskell
*** Exception: divide by zero
```

The *intMean* function is a *partial function*.  A partial function does not
handle all possible input parameters properly.  In this case it throws an
exception for the empty list instead of returning with a value of type *a*.
Avoid using and writing partial functions.  We will see many more that are
defined in *Prelude* unfortunately.

The mean of an empty list does not exist.  This means that the return value is
an optional integral value.  If the list is empty it returns *Nothing* otherwise
it returns *Just <mean>*.

``` haskell
intMean :: Integral a => [a] -> Maybe a
```

## Exercise
 * Implement the *intMean* function.
 * Implement the *meanReport :: Integral a => [a] -> String* function, that
   returns with the mean value if it exists or with the failure message: "Unable
   to compute the mean value."  Use the *intMean* function implemented in the
   previous exercise.

# Signalling failure

Let's have a look at a C function declaration.

``` c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

The socket function returns with an integer that is the file descriptor of the
allocated socket.  On failure it returns -1.  Unfortunately -1 is a valid
integer number.  The type can not be used to differentiate between success and
failure cases.

In Haskell the same function would look like:

``` haskell
socket :: Domain -> Type -> Protocol -> Maybe Socket
```
