# Currying, partial application

## Currying

Currying is a technique to convert a function with multiple arguments to many
functions with only one argument called in sequence.  I will use python this
time to demonstrate currying.

``` python
def unCurriedAdd(l, r):
  return l + r

def curriedAdd(l):
  def inner(r):
    return l + r

  return inner

unCurriedAdd(10, 15)
curriedAdd(10)(15)
```

*curriedAdd* and *inner* has only one argument.  The result of calling
*curriedAdd* is a function (*inner*) that takes a single argument and finishes
the calculation.  Every function that takes multiple arguments can be translated
this way to functions with a single argument.

Let's have a look at the type signature of the * operator.

``` haskell
(*) :: Int -> Int -> Int
(*) :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
```

The two type declarations above are equivalent because arrow associates to the
right.  Adding some parentheses changes our understanding of this function.  We
see a function taking a single *Int* parameter and returning a function.  The
returned function takes a single *Int* parameter and returns an *Int*.

## Partial application

Haskell functions are curried by default.  That is why the arguments are
separated by the same operator than the arguments and the return value.  Calling
a function with only one parameter will return a function that expects the rest
of the parameters.  This is called partial application.

``` haskell
(*) :: Int -> Int -> Int

tenTimes :: Int -> Int
tenTimes = (*) 10

tenTimesFifteen :: Int
tenTimesFifteen = tenTimes 15
```

## Exercise
 * Implement a function that concatenates two strings.

``` haskell
concat :: String -> String -> String
```

 * Implement a function that given a name, returns the "hello name" String.
   Use the *concat* function from the previous exercise.

``` haskell
greet :: String -> String
```

## Infix operators

Infix operators need to be put between parentheses if they are not used in an
infix position.

``` haskell
2 ^ 10 == (^) 2 10
2 ^ 10 == (2^) 10
2 ^ 10 == (^10) 2
```

Any binary function can be used in an infix position by putting the function
name between backticks.

``` haskell
mod 10 3 == 10 `mod` 3
```

## Exercise
 * Implement the *greets* function.

```haskell
"Luke" `greets` "Leia" == "Luke: Hello Leia!"
```
