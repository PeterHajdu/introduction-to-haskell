## If expression

If expressions have the following form:

``` haskell
if <condition> then <trueExpr> else <falseExpr>
```

*condition* is a *Boolean* expression.  If *condition* evaluates to *True* than
the whole *if* expression will evaluate to the value of *trueExpr* otherwise it
will evaluate to the value of *falseExpr*.

If expressions differ from their imperative counterparts in that both
*trueExpr* and *falseExpr* needs to be defined and they need to be of the same
type.

### Exercise
 * Implement the following function using *if* expressions.

``` haskell
fizzBuzz :: Integer -> String
```

## Guards

Guards can be used instead of top level if expressions.

``` haskell
oddOrEven :: Integer -> String
oddOrEven n
  | even n = "even"
  | otherwise = "odd"
```

In the previous example there are two guards defined.  The first is *even n* and
the second is *otherwise*.  The function will evaluate to the body of the first
guard that evaluates to true.  The function call will end up in a runtime error
if none of the guards match.  Just start ghci and check the type of the
functions if you do not know what they are.

### Exercise
 * What is the value of *otherwise*?
 * Rewrite *fizzBuzz* using *guards*.
 * Delete the finishing *otherwise* guard from the *fizzBuzz* function and compile
   the source file with the *-Wall* flag.  Try to understand the warning message.

``` bash
$ ghc -Wall fizzBuzz.hs
```

 * Call the incomplete *fizzBuzz* function with an integer that will not match
   any guards.
