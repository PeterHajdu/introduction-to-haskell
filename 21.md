# Input / Output

Let's revisit the functions in the example from yesterday.

``` haskell
readName :: IO String
readName = do
  putStrLn "What is your name?"
  getLine
```

The *readName* function has to return an action that will produce a string.
The definition starts with the *do* keyword.  The *do* keyword allows us to
write IO code that looks very similar to imperative programming.  We will see
how to write IO code without *do* notation.  *getLine* in the last line of the
definition will return with a value of type *IO String*.  That is the same as
the *readName* function's return value.  When using *do* notation the last
line's value is going to be returned from the function.

## Exercise
 * What is the type of *putStrLn "What is your name?*
 * Delete the last line of *readName* and try to compile the code.
 * The *return* function let's you construct IO actions that produce the value
   that is passed to it as a parameter.  The type of *return True* is *IO
   Boolean*. It will produce the value True when evaluated.  Try to fix the
   *readName* function using *return*.

``` haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  name <- readName
  putStrLn ("It is nice to meet you " ++ name ++ "!")
```

The type of main is *IO ()*.  It has the same type as the last line in the *do*
block (*putStrLn ...*).  The second line is more interesting.  Inside a *do*
block you can extract the value of other *IO* actions.  The type of *readName*
is *IO String* and the type of *name* is *String*.  The left arrow notation can
be used only to extract values from actions.  If you would like to define values
that are constructed by plain functions without any IO action, you can use
*let*.

``` haskell
import Data.Char

main :: IO ()
main = do
  name <- readName
  let capitalizedName = capitalize name
  putStrLn ("It is nice to meet you " ++ capitalizedName ++ "!")
  where capitalize = map toUpper
```
*capitalizedName* is a simple *String* just as *capitalize name*.

## Exercise
  * The *readMaybe* function can be used to parse values of types that implement
    the *Read* typeclass.  It returns with *Maybe* and if it fails to parse the
    value it returns *Nothing*.  Try out the following lines in ghci.

``` haskell
:t readMaybe
readMaybe :: Read a => String -> Maybe a
readMaybe "10" :: Maybe Int
readMaybe "10" :: Maybe Double
readMaybe "foo" :: Maybe Int
```

  * Write a function that reads a string from the user and inside the function
    it converts it to an Int using *readMaybe*.  (hint: The type should reflect
    the possibility of failure.)
  * Modify the function to keep asking for a number until the user enters a
    valid input.  The type signature should be *IO Int*.  (hint: Case
    expressions are allowed in *do* notation.  Use recursion.  You can construct
    IO actions from arbitrary values using *return*.)
  * Is it possible to write a function that prints to the screen or reads some
    input whose type does not contain *IO*?
  * Is it possible to call a function whose type dose not contain *IO*, but deep
    in the stack, it calls a function with a type containing *IO*.
