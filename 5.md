## If expression

If expressions have the following form:

``` haskell
if <condition> then <trueExpr> else <falseExpr>
```

*condition* is a *Boolean* expression.  If *condition* evaluates to *True* than
the whole *if* expression will evaluate to the value of *trueExpr* otherwise it
will evaluate to the value of *falseExpr*.

If expressions differ from their imperative counterparts in that both
*trueExpr* and *falseExpr* needs to be defined and they need to be of the same
type.

### Exercise
 * Implement the following function using *if* expressions.

``` haskell
oddOrEven :: Integer -> String
```

## Guards

Guards can be used instead of top level if expressions.

``` haskell
oddOrEven :: Integer -> String
oddOrEven n
  | even n = "even"
  | otherwise = "odd"
```

In the previous example there are two guards defined.  The first is *even n* and
the second is *otherwise*.  The function will evaluate to the body of the first
guard that evaluates to true.  The function call will end up in a runtime error
if none of the guards match.

### Exercise
 * What is the value of *otherwise*?
 * Write the following function using guards:

``` haskell
fizzBuzz :: Integer -> String
```

 * Delete the finishing *otherwise* guard from the *fizzBuzz* function and compile
   the source file with the *-Wall* flag.  Try to understand the warning message.

``` bash
$ ghc -Wall fizzBuzz.hs
```

 * Call the incomplete *fizzBuzz* function with an integer that will not match
   any guards.

# Scope

It is a common pattern in software engineering to split up complex expressions
to small subexpressions and compose them.  This way they become more
comprehensible to the human mind.  So far every expression we have defined can
be used in every other expression.  This is referred to as *top level binding*.
However if the purpose of splitting up an expression is not code reuse it is
beneficial to decrease the scope of visibility.

## The let expression

*Let* expressions can be used everywhere where an expression can be used.

``` haskell
cylinderVolume :: Double -> Double -> Double
cylinderVolume radius height = let square x = x * x
                                   baseArea = (square radius) * pi
                                in baseArea * height
```

Local bindings can be created between *let* and *in*.  These bindings can be
used only in the expression following *in*.
