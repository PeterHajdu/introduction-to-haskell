# Lambda functions

Lambda functions are anonymous functions.  When you need a small function and
you do not want to create a separate declaration, a lambda function might be the
best choice.

Let's have a look at a few examples.
``` haskell
\x -> x + 2
\x y -> x + y
```

The "\" character resembles lambda.  Between lambda and "->" are the function
parameters, after that is the function body.  You can use lambda functions
everywhere where you would use a function.

``` haskell
map (\x -> if even x then "even" else "odd") [1..10]
```

## Exercise

  * Read a line from standard input and write out the length of each word in
    order.  Try to use lambda functions and higher order functions.

``` bash
Please enter a line: this is a line
[4, 2, 1, 4]
```

  * Try to print out the result using *mapM_* or *traverse*.  First have a look
    at their type signature.  If it looks intimidating try to replace type
    constructors with *IO* and *[]*.

  * Rewrite at least three old exercises to use lambda functions instead of
    writing separate named functions.
