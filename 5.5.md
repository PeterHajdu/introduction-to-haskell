# Scope

It is a common pattern in software engineering to split up complex expressions
to small subexpressions and compose them.  This way they become more
comprehensible to the human mind.  So far every expression we have defined can
be used in every other expression.  This is referred to as *top level binding*.
However if the purpose of splitting up an expression is not code reuse it is
beneficial to decrease the scope of visibility.

## The let expression

*Let* expressions can be used everywhere where an expression can be used.

``` haskell
cylinderVolume :: Double -> Double -> Double
cylinderVolume radius height = let square x = x * x
                                   baseArea = (square radius) * pi
                                in baseArea * height
```

Local bindings can be created between *let* and *in*.  These bindings can be
used only in the expression following *in*.

### Exercise
 * Split up the following function to subexpressions using *let*.

``` haskell
averageCircleSpeed :: Double -> [Double] -> Double
averageCircleSpeed radius laps = 2 * radius * pi / ((sum laps) / (fromIntegral (length laps)))
```

## Where

Unlike *let* expressions, *where* is not an expression.  It is a special
construct that can be used only in specific places.  One possible place is at
the end of function definitions.  Definitions following the *where* keyword can be
used in the whole function body including *let* expressions.

``` haskell
cylinderVolume :: Double -> Double -> Double
cylinderVolume radius height = baseArea * height
  where square x = x * x
        baseArea = (square radius) * pi
```

### Exercise
 * Split up *averageCircleSpeed* using *where*.
