# Declarations and Functions

## Declarations

Let's revisit our first program from day one.

``` haskell
module Main where

message = "Good bye imperative world!"
main = putStrLn message
```

I have defined *message* to be *"Good bye imperative world!"*.  In Haskell
*message* is not a variable.  It is the name of the given expression.
"=" stands for definition not assignment.

### Exercise:
 * Try to assign a new value to *message* and compile *Hello.hs*.

``` haskell
module Main where

message = "Good bye imperative world!"
message = "Hello Haskell!"

main = putStrLn message
```

It is good practice to give type signature at least to top level bindings.  The
previous example with types looks like this:

``` haskell
module Main where

message :: String
message = "Good bye imperative world!"

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn message
```

*message* is of type *String* and *main* is of type *IO ()*.  Do not let the
type of *main* intimidate you.  We will get there soon.

### Exercise
 * Add type annotations to the following Haskell program.

``` haskell
module Main where

someNumber = [1..10]

main = print someNumber
```

## Functions

### Function definitions

Functions are first class citizens in Haskell.  This means that they can be
passed as an argument or returned from a function.  Haskell function definitions
do not differ from ordinary definitions much.  The function name is followed by
the parameter names, an equal sign and the function definition.  However type
signature can be strange at first sight.  The function name is followed by
two double colons and the parameter types separated by *->*.  The last type is
the return value of the function.

``` haskell
double :: Int -> Int
double n = n * 2

times :: Int -> Int -> Int
times n multiplier = n * multiplier
```

The *double* function takes an *Int* as the first parameter and returns an
*Int*.  The *times* function takes two *Int* parameters and returns an *Int*.

### Calling a function

Calling a Haskell function is the most natural thing in the language.  Just
follow the function name with the parameters.

``` haskell
double 10
times 2 10
putStrLn "Hello world!"
```

Function application associates to the left and has the highest precedence.

### Exercises
 * Correct the following Haskell program by adding parentheses.
 * Add type annotation to all top level bindings.

``` Haskell
module Main where
double n = n * 2
times n multiplier = n * multiplier
calculation = times double 10 20
main = print calculation
```
