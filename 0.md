# Introduction

Welcome to the *Introduction to Haskell* course.  We will walk through the
basic language features in a couple of weeks in small steps.  It takes a lot of
practice to learn a new language especially if it is fundamentally different
from the ones you already know, so I expect you to spend every day ten to
fifteen minutes consuming the material and writing Haskell code.

# Prerequisites

I assume that you have basic programming experience in an imperative language
such as: c, c++, java.
