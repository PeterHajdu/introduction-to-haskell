# Type aliases

Type aliases can be used to give other names to a given type.  This way type
signatures can document the code much better.

``` haskell
-- Without type aliases.
data Person = Person String Int

-- Using type aliases.
type Name = String
type Age = Int
data Person = Person Name Age
```

Another usage might be to give a short name to long types if they are used in
many places.

``` haskell
type StrangeTable = [(Id, Either Person Vehicle)]
```
