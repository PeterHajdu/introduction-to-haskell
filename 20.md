# Input / Output

Why would you write a program without interacting with the real world?  If there
is no observable behavior of your program, than it might not even exist.  The *IO*
type is responsible in Haskell to describe a program's interaction with the
outside world.

## The IO type

Let's have a look at the type signature of a few functions that interact with
the outside world.

``` haskell
getLine :: IO String
```

The *getLine* function reads a line from the command line.  Let's have a look at
the type of the return value.  We have *String* in there which stands for the
line that is read from the command line.  *IO* is a type that expects one type
parameter, in this case it is *String*. We have seen types with type parameters
already (*[Int], Maybe String, Either Int Bool*).  IO is just one of them.

*IO a* describes an action that will eventually result in a value of type *a*.
*getLine* is an action that when it gets executed will result in a value of type
*String*.  Think about these actions as recipes.  It is a list of things to do.
When your program is executed they are going to be cooked.  Until then they are
just arbitrary values with a type of *IO a*.

``` haskell
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
```

The putStrLn function prints its first parameter to the screen.  The return
value is much more interesting.  *()* is called unit.  Unit has one possible
value *()*.

It would look like this as an ADT:
``` haskell
data () = ()
```

Let's get back to the original type *IO ()*.  *putStrLn* describes an *IO*
action that when executed will result in a value of type *()*.  In this case
*()* is just a placeholder, since IO has to have a type parameter, but an action
that prints to the screen has nothing meaningful to return with.

## Purity

Haskell is a pure language.  This means that if I call a function with the same
parameters it will return the same value every time.  Languages like python are
not pure.  A python function might set a global random seed.  Functions
depending on this random seed generate an unexpected value every time the seed
is modified.  The functions modifying the random seed and generator have side
effects,  in this case they mutate global state.  If functions are allowed to
have side effects, the language can not be pure.

We have just seen two functions that interact with the user.  Printing to the
screen changes the state of the world.  Isn't that global mutable state?  If I
read a line from the console, it returns a different line every time I execute
it.  How is Haskell pure than?

The answer to all of this questions lies in the fact that the functions
interacting with the world return a value of type *IO a*, not *a*.  They just
describe the action that is going to happen when they are executed.  However the
action is the same every time.

*putStrLn "hello"* will return an *IO* action that prints out "hello" to the
screen every time it is called.  The *IO* action is the same as long as the
parameters are the same.

## Example

Create a file Greet.hs with the following content:
``` haskell
module Main where

readName :: IO String
readName = do
  putStrLn "What is your name?"
  name <- getLine
  return name

main :: IO ()
main = do
  name <- readName
  putStrLn ("It is nice to meet you " ++ name ++ "!")
```

Compile it with *ghc* and start it.

``` bash
$ ghc ./Greet.hs
$ ./Greet
```

There are a lot of interesting things here that we will explain only in the next
lecture.  Try to use the patterns in the example to complete the exercises.

## Exercise
  * Create the type *Person* that has the following fields: *name*, *age*. (age
    can be String for now)
  * Ask the user to enter a name and an age.
  * Build a value of type *Person* with the values entered by the user.
  * Print out the value you have created.
