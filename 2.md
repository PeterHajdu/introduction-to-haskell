# Expressions and values

## GHCI

*ghc* ships with an interactive shell called *ghci*.  It is a convenient tool to
try out things without editing and compiling a source file.  Start *ghci* in a
shell and get used to it by trying out every code snippet in the lecture.

## Expressions and values

Expressions evaluate to a value.  In Haskell everything is an expression.  All
computations are done by evaluating expressions.

Type the following expressions in *ghci* line by line.  Try to guess the value
they evaluate to before pressing enter.

``` haskell
not (False || True && True)
not False || True && True

1 + 2 * 10
2 ^ (div 9 2)

2^2 * pi
12.3 / 0.123

length ("hello " ++ "there!")
length "hello" + 10

[1,2,3] ++ [10,11,12]
[1..10] ++ [(-10)..(-1)]
```

## Types

Haskell is statically typed.  Every expression has a type which is checked by
the compiler during compilation.  Programs with type errors are not compiled.
You can use *ghci* to inspect the type of expressions by prefixing the
expression with **:t**.

``` ghci
Prelude> :t True
True :: Bool
```

Check the type of all of the expressions in the previous block.  Don't just type
them in but try to guess the result.  Some of them is going to be scary at
first.  Do not worry, you will understand all of them in a couple of days.

So far we did not specify the type of our expressions explicitly.  We could get
away with it because *ghc* tries to find out the types for us.  This is called
type inference.  Every time we write an expression we can explicitly specify the
type by postfixing the expression with *:: typename*.

``` ghci
Prelude> 2*10
20
Prelude> 2*(10 :: Int)
20
Prelude> 2*(10 :: Double)
20.0
Prelude> :t 10
10 :: Num a => a
Prelude> :t 10 :: Int
10 :: Int :: Int
```

## Exercises

* Write at least three expressions that has a type error in them.  Try them out in
  *ghci*.
* Add or remove explicit type notations to the following expression to resolve
  the type error.  Note: Integers can not be divided with the */* operator.

``` haskell
(10 :: Int) / 2
```
