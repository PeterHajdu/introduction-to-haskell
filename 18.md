# Higher order functions

## Filter

Let's start again with the type.

``` haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
```

The first parameter is a function that maps values from type *a* to *Bool*.  The
second parameter is a list of *a*s.  The result type is a list of *a*s.

We can create a list of *a*s only from the second parameter.  The function is
used to decide whether an element of the second parameter should be included in
the result.

Start ghci and try out the following lines:

``` haskell
:t filter
:t even
:t filter even
filter even [1..10]
```

### Exercise
 * Use *filter* on the *knights* list defined in the previous lecture to filter
   knights whose favourite colour is green or red.
 * Complete the following function implementation:

``` haskell
myfilter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
myfilter pred [] = ???
myfilter pred (x:xs)
 | pred x = x : ???
 | otherwise = myfilter pred xs
```
