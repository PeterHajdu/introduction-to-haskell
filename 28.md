# Function composition

Functions in Haskell can be composed just as they can be in math.  If the
function types match you can compose them by simply putting a dot between them.

``` haskell
:t (.)
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

The composition operator takes two function parameter and returns a function.
