# Function composition

Functions in Haskell can be composed just as they can be in math.  If the
function types match you can compose them by simply putting a dot between them.

``` haskell
:t (.)
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
```

The composition operator takes two function parameters and returns the function
that is the composition of its parameters.

## Exercise:

  * What is the type of the following functions and what are they doing?

``` haskell
show . (*2)
length . (++[1..10])
(+2) . (*10)
```

  * Rewrite your code from the lambda function lecture to print out *even* if
    the length of the word is even and *odd* otherwise.  The following function
    might be useful *evenOdd :: Bool -> String*.  Use higher order functions and
    function composition.

  * Create an operator that does the same thing as (.) but with the parameters
    swapped.

``` haskell
(>>>) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> a -> c
f >>> g = undefined
```

# Function application operator ($)

The *$* operator can be used to reduce the number of parentheses.  Consider the
following function call.

``` haskell
even (length [1..10])
```

The parentheses are needed because function application has the highest
precedence in Haskell.  If you delete the parentheses ghc thinks that you would
like to call *even* with two parameters:

  * *length* function
  * list [1..10]

You can use the function application operator to avoid the use of parentheses.

``` haskell
even $ length [1..10]
```

The *$* operator will simply call the left parameter on the right parameter.  It
has the lowest precedence value so both parameters are going to be evaluated
before applying the function to the parameter.

## Exercise

  * Rewrite at least three old exercises to use function application operator
    instead of parentheses.
