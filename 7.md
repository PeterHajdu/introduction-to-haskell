# Algebraic data types

Haskell allows programmers to create their own data types through algebraic data
types.  *ADT* definitions start with the *data* keyword.  It is followed by a *type
constructor*, an equal sign and *data constructors*.

``` haskell
data <type constructor> = <data constructors>
```

*ADT*s can express disjunction and conjuction in your data types.  Disjunction
is expressed with *Sum* types, conjuction is expressed with *Product* types.

## Sum types

*Sum* types can be used to express *enumeration types*.  In the following
example we introduce a type named *Colour*.  It is possible to instantiate
values of the *Colour* type with one of the *data constructors*, namely: *Red*,
*Green*, *Blue*, *Yellow* or *Brown*.

Create a file called *Colours.hs* with the content:
``` haskell
module Colour where

data Colour = Red
            | Green
            | Blue
            | Yellow
            | Brown

aColour :: Colour
aColour = Blue

someColours :: [Colour]
someColours = [Red, Green, Brown]
```

### Exercise
 * Add an *ADT* called *Knight* to *Colours.hs* with possible values: *Arthur*,
   *Galahad*, *Robin*, *Lancelot*, *Bedevere*.
 * Define the *favouriteColour :: Knight -> Colour* function and try it out in
   *ghci*.
