# Algebraic data types

Haskell allows programmers to create their own data types through algebraic data
types.

``` haskell
data <type constructor> = <data constructor>
```

*ADT* definitions start with the *data* keyword.  It is followed by a *type
constructor*, an equal sign and *data constructors*.

## Sum types
## Product types
## Record syntax
