# Recursive types

List is a recursive type.  This means that at least one of the data constructors
have a field with its own type.  In the case of list it is the second operand
of *(:)*

## Working with recursive types

**TODO**: recursive functions...

## Another recursive type

*Rose tree* or *multi-way tree* is another example of recursive types.

Create RoseTree.hs with the following content.

``` haskell
data RoseTree a = RoseTree a [RoseTree a] deriving (Show, Eq)
```

## Exercise
 * Create the following tree.

``` haskell
exampleTree = RoseTree 10 [RoseTree 1 [],RoseTree 2 [RoseTree 12 []],RoseTree 3 []]
```

 * Implement the following function.

``` haskell
traverseRose :: RoseTree a -> [a]
(traverseRose exampleTree) == [1, 12, 2, 3, 10]
```
