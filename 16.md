# Recursive types

List is a recursive type.  This means that at least one of the data constructors
have a field with its own type.  In the case of list it is the second operand
of *(:)*.

## Working with recursive types

One way of working with recursive data types is to use recursive functions.
Let's have a look at examples with the built in List type.

``` haskell
myLast :: [a] -> Maybe a
myLast [] = Nothing
myLast (x:[]) = Just x
myLast (x:xs) = myLast xs
```

The last element of an empty list does not exist.  In the second line we
pattern match on the *cons* constructor if the tail is an empty list.  This
means that the last element is *x*, so we return with it.  The last line can
only match if the list is not empty and the tail (*xs*) is not an empty list.
In this case we ask for the last element of tail.

### Exercise
 * Write a function that picks the second last element of a list.  (Hint:
   Try to use consecutive *(:)* constructors in one pattern.)

## Another recursive type

*Rose tree* or *multi-way tree* is another example of recursive types.

Create RoseTree.hs with the following content.

``` haskell
data RoseTree a = RoseTree a [RoseTree a] deriving (Show, Eq)
```

## Exercise
 * Create the following tree.

``` haskell
exampleTree = RoseTree 10 [RoseTree 1 [],RoseTree 2 [RoseTree 12 []],RoseTree 3 []]
```

 * Implement the following function.

``` haskell
traverseRose :: RoseTree a -> [a]
(traverseRose exampleTree) == [1, 12, 2, 3, 10]
```
