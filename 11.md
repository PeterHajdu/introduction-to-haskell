## Ad-hoc polymorphism

Let's implement a function that concatenates the String representation of two
values of any type.  We will use the *show* function to convert a value to
String.

``` haskell
concatString :: a -> b -> String
concatString x y = show x ++ show y
```

This version of *concatString* does not compile.  The problem is that *a* and
*b* can be any type, so we do not know if it is possible to convert them to a
String.  We need to *constrain* the type variables to tell ghc that *a* and *b*
can be converted to a String.

``` haskell
concatString :: (Show a, Show b) => a -> b -> String
concatString x y = show x ++ show y
```

In this version we tell ghc that it should substitute only those types in *a*
and *b* that implement the *Show typeclass*.  Typeclasses can be thought of as
interfaces for now.

``` haskell
class Show where
  show :: a -> String
```

The *Show* typeclass declares the *show* function.  Every type that wants to be
an *instance* of *Show* needs to implement a show function with the given type
signature.  When ghc compiles the concatString function, it sees that both
arguments should implement the Show typeclass, therefore they need to have an
implementation of the *show* function.

## Implementing a typeclass instance

``` haskell
data Propulsion = Wind | Diesel

concatString Wind 10
```

This snippet can not be compiled since the *Propulsion* type does not implement
the *Show* interface.

``` haskell
instance Show Propulsion where
  show Wind = "Wind"
  show Diesel = "Diesel"
```

Now that we have an implementation of Show and therefore the show function,
everything should be fine.  However the implementation looks really
straightforward.  For some typeclasses ghc can derive default implementations
for us.

``` haskell
data Propulsion = Wind | Diesel deriving (Show)
```

With this declaration ghc generates an implementation of the *Show* interface.

## Some more typeclasses

The more constrains we have, the less types can be substituted.  The more
constrains we have, the more we know about the types that can be substituted so
the more things we can do with them in our functions.  However there is no point
in constraining a type if we do not use the extra interfaces in the function
body.  The rule of thumb is that your functions should be as generic as they can
be.

Let's see a silly example of too much constrains.
``` haskell
identity :: (Show a, Eq a) => a -> a
identity x = x
```

Another thing to consider is that the less we know about the function types the
more we know about what a function might do by looking at the type declaration
only.  The more we know about the parameter types the less we know about the
functions behavior just by looking at the type signature.

What might these functions do?

``` haskell
f :: a -> a
g :: a -> b -> a
h :: Int -> Int -> Int
```

## Exercises
  * Correct the following function by constraining type variable *a*.  The
    function should accept *Double* and *Int* parameters as well.
``` haskell
plusTwo :: a -> a
plusTwo x = x + 2
```
  * Implement the *Eq* typeclass instance of *Propulsion* and try to compare two
    values with the == operator.
  * Modify the *Propulsion* type to derive the *Ord* typeclass automatically and
    try to compare two values with the < operator.
