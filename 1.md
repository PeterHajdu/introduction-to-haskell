# First steps
Today you will set up a basic development environment and write your first
Haskell program.

## Development environment
First you need to set up a development environment.  The easiest way is to
install the Haskell platform which contains much more than what we need now.
You will find specific instructions for your operating system
[here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
Today we are going to need only *ghc* the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

## First Haskell program
Create the *Hello.hs* file with you favourite text editor with the following
content.  Please type it in instead of just copy pasting.

``` haskell
module Main where
main = putStrLn "Good bye imperative world!"
```

The next step is to compile and run it.  Assuming you are using some kind of
Unix like operating system.

``` bash
$ ghc ./Hello.hs
$ ./Hello
```

We defined the Main module in the *Hello.hs* file.  Modules are used to control
name spaces and to organize source code.  The *Main* module is expected to have
a function called *main*.  The execution of a program starts with the *main*
function.

## Exercises

* Modify *Hello.hs* to print out the following text: *"My favourite text editor
is vim!"*
* Delete the *main* function and compile *Hello.hs*.  Try to understand the
  error message.
