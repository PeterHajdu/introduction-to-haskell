# Algebraic Data Types

Sum and product types together are called Algebraic Data Types.

``` haskell
data Shape = Triangle {a :: Double, b :: Double, c :: Double}
           | Rectangle {width :: Double, height :: Double}
```

## Exercise
 * Write a type called *Vehicle* that has the following data constructors:
   *Ship*, *Car*, *Plane*.  Try to come up with different fields for each.  Use
   the types from the previous lecture.

# General pattern matching

Let's revisit pattern matching for algebraic data types.

``` haskell
perimeter :: Shape -> Double
perimeter (Triangle a b c) = a + b + c
perimeter (Rectangle width height) = 2 * (width + height)
```

The single perimeter function can work on all kinds of shape values.  Pattern
matching can be combined with *guards*.

``` haskell
function (pattern1) | predicate1 = w
                    | predicate2 = x

function (pattern2) | predicate3 = y
                    | predicate4 = z
```

## Exercise
 * Write the *price :: Vehicle -> Double* function.

# Case expressions

We have used pattern matching to deconstruct function parameters so far.
There are a few other places where pattern matching can be used.  One of these
is a *case* expression.

``` haskell
report :: Shape -> String
report shape = let perimeter = case shape of
                                    (Triangle a b c) -> a + b + c
                                    (Rectangle width height) -> 2 * (width + height)
               in "perimeter of shape: " ++ show perimeter
```

## Exercise
 * Rewrite the price function using case expressions.
