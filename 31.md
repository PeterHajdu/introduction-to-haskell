# Last lecture

There are a few more closing thoughts that might help you to continue your
Haskell journey.

### Write code

Instead of reading a lot of articles or tutorials write as much code as
possible.  The only way to learn a language is by practicing it.

### String

Although I have used the *String* type in all of the lectures, you should know,
that it is not used in real world applications.  When you deal with text or
binary data you should use *Text* or *ByteString*.

### Streaming data

Streaming data is rarely processed with lazy data structures.  Have a look at the
*Pipes* or *Conduit* library.

### The m word

Do not read blog posts about monad.  Write code and try to use them.

### The End

Thank you very much for your attention.  I hope you have enjoyed my course and
it will help you on your way to learn Haskell.  Do not forget that this is a
really basic introductory course.  Many Haskell materials are not that easy to
consume.  Do not give up.  Look for material that suits your level of
understanding.  Do not forget to write a lot of code!
