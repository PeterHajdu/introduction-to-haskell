# Signalling failure

Many C function returns with a negative integer on failure.  Different negative
values might give information about the type of failure.  This can not be solved
with *Maybe*.

# Either

``` haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
```

The *Either* type is used to represent either a value of type *a* constructed
with the *Left* data constructor or a value of type *b* constructed with
*Right*.  It is generally used to wrap the result of a computation that might
fail.  By convention the *Left* constructor is used to represent the failure case and
the *Right* constructor is used for the success case.  The wrapped values can be
extracted with pattern matching.

## Example

The following code won't compile, but demonstraits the idea well.

``` haskell
data Message = Message {message :: Maybe String, signature :: Maybe String}

data MessageError = MissingMessage | MissingSignature | InvalidSignature deriving Show

getMessageContent :: Message -> Either MessageError String
getMessageContent (Message Nothing _) = Left MissingMessage
getMessageContent (Message _ Nothing) = Left MissingSignature
getMessageContent (Message content signature = if validSignature content signeture
                                               then Right content
                                               else Left InvalidSignature

report :: Message -> String
report msg = case getMessageContent msg of
               Left reason -> "Failed to get content: " ++ show reason
               Right content -> "The content is: " ++ content
```

## Exercise
 * Implement the following functions.

``` haskell
data MeanError = EmptyList deriving Show
intMean :: Integral a => [a] -> Either DivError a
intMeanReport :: Show a => Either DivError a -> String
```
